## The Business Problem

Premier Standard Industrial Limited (PSIL) is a 40-year-old Nigerian distribution company and sole distributor of Alltech Coppens fish feeds in Nigeria and West Africa. Operating across five branches — Lagos, Aba, Ibadan, Port Harcourt, and Abuja — they distribute four product lines to ten active customer accounts.

Management had no systematic way to anticipate demand. Orders were reactive. Stockouts were untracked. Customer purchasing patterns were unknown.

The Managing Director asked five questions:

1. When is **Customer A** likely to place their next order?
2. What **product sizes** does Customer A typically buy?
3. What **quantity** should we prepare?
4. Which **customers** are likely to order soon?
5. Which **products** should we restock immediately?

This solution answers all five — with data.

## Selected DAX Measures

```dax
-- Predicted next order status
Order Due Status =
    VAR d = [Days Until Next Order]
    RETURN SWITCH(TRUE(),
        d < 0,   "OVERDUE",
        d = 0,   "DUE TODAY",
        d <= 3,  "DUE THIS WEEK",
        d <= 7,  "DUE IN 7 DAYS",
                 "NOT DUE SOON")

-- Inventory risk classification
Inventory Risk Status =
    VAR R = DIVIDE([Avg Inventory Level], [Demand Velocity])
    RETURN SWITCH(TRUE(),
        R < 5,   "CRITICAL - Reorder Now",
        R < 8,   "WARNING - Reorder Soon",
        R < 12,  "MONITOR",
                 "ADEQUATE")

-- Recommended reorder quantity
Recommended Reorder Qty =
    VAR D = [Demand Velocity]
    VAR L = [Avg Lead Time Days]
    VAR S = ROUND(D * 0.5 * SQRT(L), 0)
    RETURN ROUND((D * L * 2) + S, 0)
```
